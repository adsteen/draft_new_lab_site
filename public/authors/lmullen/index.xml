      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is a special one: it is our first paper out of the Malcolm X Shabazz Aquatic Geochemistry Team project. More than 60 studens from Malcolm X Shabazz High School contributed to the data collection effort, and all of them are named individually in the paper. Kim Boerrigter, who acted as a student leader of the team, earned individual authorship. Since publication, more than 40 additional students have taken part in the Team, and we continue to produce research and work towards a second publication.&lt;/p&gt;
