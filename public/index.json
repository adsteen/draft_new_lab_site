I was privileged to serve as the lead author of the Analytical Chemistry working group, in which we discussed advances since the John Hedges Memorial Symposium in 2004^[Coincidentally, this was the first conference I ever attended.], and the opportunities for technological development in marine organic geochemistry over the next decade or so.\n2004 was an interesting marker because this roughly corresponds to the period in which \u0026lsquo;omics technologies became accessible to marine organic geochemistry. Marine organic geochemists in 2020 need to be thinking about the inner workings of microbial communities in the ocean (and, indeed, my research has shifted during this period from more-or-less pure geochemistry to bioinformatics). It was interesting to me that the single point of unanimity among the reviewers of this manuscript was the idea that advances in computational techniques and tools, such as git, GitHub, and interpreted languages such as R and python, are critical to the field, so that section was substantially expanded during reviews. Going forward, it is clear that there is no meaningful organic geochemistry without microbial ecology, genomics, and even genetics.\nTypically, the flow of information has been primarily from basic microbiology to microbial ecology to organic geochemistry, at least as far as environmental biomarkers are concerned. An unexpected (to me at least) consequence of the union of \u0026lsquo;omics technologies with organic geochemistry is that it allows us to study microbes in their natural environment much more realistically. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the next seminar in this series, perhaps ten or fifteen years from now.

There has always been a strong feedback between analytical advances and scientific advances. However, whereas advances in analytical technology were often the driving force that made possible progress in elucidating the sources and fate of organic matter in the ocean in the first decades of marine organic biogeochemistry, today process-based scientific questions should drive analytical developments. Several paradigm shifts and challenges for the future are related to the intersection between analytical progress and scientific evolution. Untargeted “molecular headhunting” for its own sake is now being subsumed into process-driven targeted investigations that ask new questions and thus require new analytical capabilities. However, there are still major gaps in characterizing the chemical composition and biochemical behavior of macromolecules, as well as in generating reference standards for relevant types of organic matter. Field-based measurements are now routinely complemented by controlled laboratory experiments and in situ rate measurements of key biogeochemical processes. And finally, the multidisciplinary investigations that are becoming more common generate large and diverse datasets, requiring innovative computational tools to integrate often disparate data sets, including better global coverage and mapping. Here, we compile examples of developments in analytical methods that have enabled transformative scientific advances since 2004, and we project some challenges and opportunities in the near future. We believe that addressing these challenges and capitalizing on these opportunities will ensure continued progress in understanding the cycling of organic carbon in the ocean.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Analytical and Computational Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges in Marine Organic Biogeochemistry in an Era of “Omics”","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The SteenLab server is named marie for Marie Tharp, a pioneering oceanographer who used sounding data collected by others to create the first high-quality bathymetric map of the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans.

An account on marie. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, ask permission from Drew Steen. A virtual private network (VPN) client, such as PulseSecure, connected to University of Tennessee\u0026rsquo;s VPN. A shell on your computer.  If you are using a Mac, it is easiest to use the Bash or zsh shells that come default with OS X. This is what you get when you open the \u0026lsquo;Terminal\u0026rsquo; program. If you are using a PC, it is a little more complicated. In newer versions of Windows 10, you can enable a true, Linux-based Bash shell by enabling Windows Subsystem for Linux. If that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible, the best alternative is probably to use Git Bash. It is also possible to use the Windows-native PowerShell, but this will require you to learn two different shell languages.   A very basic understanding of how to use a Linux shell such as Bash, and a basic idea of how to use conda environments.  Getting started Take the following steps to access marie:\n Make sure that you are connected to UT\u0026rsquo;s VPN. If you are using PulseSecure, there will be a little green arrow on the PulseSecure logo when you are connected. Open your shell (Terminal on OS X, Git Bash or similar on Windows). Type ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@marie.bio.utk.edu, replacing with your username, and enter your password when prompted. You will now be connected to marie, so that any commands you type into your shell are executed on marie. Activate a conda environment. Note to self: I\u0026rsquo;d like to edit everyone\u0026rsquo;s .bashrc so that it will automatically start a lab-default conda environment on login. Congratulations! You can now run jobs on marie to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content.  Rules  Taylor Royalty is marie\u0026rsquo;s system administrator. What he says, goes.  Passwords and security marie is subject to frequent hacking attempts. We have already had to wipe the system clean once due to a successful takeover by hackers. Thus, please take these rules seriously.\n When you are given a marie account, your password will be set to a random 8-character string. I urge you to keep your password in a password manager such as LastPass, rather than an unencrypted file such as a Word document or similar. You may change your password, but if you do, change it to another randomly-generated 8-or-more character string, for example one generated by a password manager. Please do not use a password containing real words, birthdays, etc. We will inform you of your password in person or via text message or similar. Please do not write your password in an email. All of this is on the honor system. However, violation of password rules is grounds for having your marie account revoked.  Use of conda environments  Use a conda environment for all of your work. If you think you need to install software outside of a conda environment, check with Taylor or Drew first.  Hard drive use  Right now, hard drive space is not a problem. In the future we may implement limits on hard drive use. Common data sets, such as the SwissProt database, are stored at TBD. All users may read but not write to that space. Users must keep their own data in their own directory, ~/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/.

However, each user is responsible for backing up essential data, code and results. Users are urged to organize their directories logically, with one folder for each project. Within each project directory, data should be kept in the data directory, code in dedicated directories, etc. Users are strongly encouraged to keep their code under git control, so that it is easier to recover from mistakes.

Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes play a key role in the survival of microbes by enabling them to access and degrade complex organic compounds that are found in seafloor sediments. Despite their importance, extracellular enzymatic activity is poorly characterized at water depths greater than a few hundred meters where physical properties, such as pressure and temperature, create a unique environment for influencing enzyme behavior. Here, we investigated microbial communities and enzyme activities in surface sediment collected at four sampling stations in the central Mediterranean Sea at water depths ranging from 800 to 2200 m. Fluorometric assays revealed that extracellular hydrolytic activity varied according to substrate type and water depth which suggests that the distributions of these enzymes within this basin are not homogenous. Furthermore, enzyme activities indicated substantial demand for phosphomonoesters and proteins, with measurable but much lower demand for polysaccharides. Barcoded amplicon sequencing of bacterial and archaeal SSU genes revealed that microbial communities varied across sampling stations and some groups displayed water-depth related trends. Our results demonstrate that heterotrophic capabilities of microbes in deep-sea Mediterranean sediments can differ substantially even within the same region.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Patterns in extracellular enzyme activity and microbial diversity in deep-sea Mediterranean sediments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"This review of the fate of organic carbon in marine sediments came from a C-DEBI-funded workshop that Doug and I organized in Knoxville in March of 2018.

Although much has been learned about the factors that promote and hinder rates of organic carbon degradation in natural systems, the controls on the distribution of organic carbon in modern and ancient sediments are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize how recent findings are changing entrenched perspectives on organic matter degradation in marine sediments: a shift from a structurally-based chemical reactivity viewpoint towards an emerging acceptance of the role of the ecosystem in organic matter degradation rates. That is, organic carbon has a range of reactivities determined by not only the nature of the organic compounds, but by the biological, geochemical, and physical attributes of its environment. This shift in mindset has gradually come about due to a greater diversity of sample sites, the molecular revolution in biology, discoveries concerning the extent and limits of life, advances in quantitative modeling, investigations of ocean carbon cycling under a variety of extreme paleo-conditions (e.g. greenhouse environments, euxinic/anoxic oceans), the application of novel analytical techniques and interdisciplinary efforts. Adopting this view across scientific disciplines will enable additional progress in understanding how marine sediments influence the global carbon cycle.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The fate of organic carbon in marine sediments - New insights from recent data and analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":[],"content":"A little while ago I was asked by C-DEBI to give a webinar* for their Professional Development Series on work-life balance. Now, I can\u0026rsquo;t claim to have any particular insight into that subject, but while I was preparing for it, I did stumble on an idea that has stuck with me: **the idea of \u0026lsquo;work-life balance\u0026rsquo; is totally the wrong frame** for how to think about allocating our time between research and non-research stuff.\nThe reason for this is that our work is part of our lives. Why do I do science for a living? For me, and for most of us I suspect, there are two reasons:\n Science can be thrilling, and since I was a kid I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to make discoveries about the world, and I need to pay the rent.  I really try hard to keep those reasons in mind when I\u0026rsquo;m deciding what time to go home, when to spend a day with my kids vs. working, etc. When I do, it makes my analysis simpler: I work when a.) I need to, to pay the rent, or b.) I want to, becuase it is fun. As a practical matter, that means that I\u0026rsquo;m generally at work from when I drop my kids off at school at about 8 am until about 5 pm on weekdays. I try hard to be present for my family on weekday evenings before bedtime and most of the day on weekends. I often work for an hour or two between the kids\u0026rsquo; bedtime and mine, and I might work some more on the weekends, depending on what is going on for my family and how pressing my work deadlines are.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a pretty typical schedule for an academic in my position, I think, so my analytical frame doesn\u0026rsquo;t get me to anywhere unusual in terms of my time allocation. It does, however, free me to feel great about the decision not to work when I could be working, because I recognize that the purpose of my work is to support my life, rather than the other way around. But sometimes I choose to work extra, either because my science is just too exciting not to, or because I feel like I really need to bust my butt in order to keep my job. Again, that\u0026rsquo;s nothing radical, but it serves as a powerful antidote to the pervasive notion in science that we could always be doing more to push our science (and our career) further.\nDr. Natasha Dowey recently asked an insightful question about how to lead a fulfilling life without allowing one\u0026rsquo;s research to \u0026lsquo;suffer\u0026rsquo;:\nI think just about all of us have this question in the back of our minds a lot of the time. But this question contains a category error: research can\u0026rsquo;t suffer. It isn\u0026rsquo;t sentient. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t get sad if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get done. People suffer, and we can certainly suffer if we don\u0026rsquo;t get enough research out to keep the job that we want, but when we think about allocating our time in terms of benefit to ourselves and the people we care about, it becomes a lot easier to decide how much our our finite time on Earth to spend at work.\n  The webinar is archived here, for those who are super-interested in more of my thoughts on the subject.

However, these methods do not provide useful information when a gene does not have a close match in the database. In addition, each comparison can be costly when the database is large since it requires alignments and a series of string comparisons. In this work we propose a novel approach: using recurrent neural networks to embed DNA or amino-acid sequences in a low-dimensional space in which distances correlate with functional similarity. This embedding space overcomes both shortcomings of the method of aligning sequences and comparing homology. First, it allows us to obtain information about genes which do not have exact matches by measuring their similarity to other ones in the database. If our database is labeled this can provide labels for a query gene as is done in traditional methods. However, even if the database is unlabeled it allows us to find clusters and infer some characteristics of the gene population. In addition, each comparison is much faster than traditional methods since the distance metric is reduced to the Euclidean distance, and thus efficient approximate nearest neighbor algorithms can be used to find the best match. We present results showing the advantage of our algorithm. More specifically we show how our embedding can be useful for both classification tasks when our labels are known, and clustering tasks where our sequences belong to classes which have not been seen before.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Unaligned Sequence Similarity Search Using Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taylor Royalty","Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568052550,"objectID":"8a04847e17785c302edb195849a73fe3","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2019_royalty_partitioning/","publishdate":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_royalty_partitioning/","section":"publication","summary":"Widely used microbial taxonomies, such as the NCBI taxonomy, are based on a combination of sequence homology among conserved genes and historically accepted taxonomies, which were developed based on observable traits such as morphology and physiology.

This provides the first opportunity to completely separate taxonomy from traits and therefore to quantify how taxonomic rank corresponds to traits across the microbial tree of life. We quantified the relative abundances of clusters of orthologous group functional categories (COG-FCs) as a proxy for traits within the lineages of 13,735 cultured and uncultured microbial lineages from a custom-curated genome database.

The fate of EPS in the water column is in part determined by activities of heterotrophic microbes capable of utilizing EPS compounds as carbon and energy sources. To evaluate the potential of natural microbial communities to degrade EPS produced during oil degradation, we measured potential hydrolysis rates of six structurally distinct polysaccharides in two roller bottle experiments, using water from a natural oil seep in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The suite of polysaccharides used to measure the initial step in carbon degradation is indicative of polymers within microbial EPS. The treatments included (i) unamended surface or deep waters (whole water), and water amended with (ii) a water-accommodated fraction of oil (WAF), (iii) oil dispersant Corexit 9500, and (iv) WAF chemically-enhanced with Corexit (CEWAF). The oil and Corexit treatments were employed to simulate conditions during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Polysaccharide hydrolysis rates in the surface-water treatments were lowest in the WAF treatment, despite elevated levels of EPS in the form of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). In contrast, the three deep-water treatments (WAF, Corexit, CEWAF) showed enhanced hydrolysis rates and TEP levels (WAF) compared to the whole water. We also observed variations in the spectrum of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzyme activities among the treatments. These substrate specificities were likely driven by activities of oil-degrading bacteria, shaping the pool of EPS and TEP as well as degradation products of hydrocarbons and Corexit compounds. A model calculation of potential turnover rates of organic carbon within the TEP pool suggests extended residence times of TEP in oil-contaminated waters, making them prone to serve as the sticky matrix for oily aggregates known as marine oil snow.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Polysaccharide hydrolysis in the presence of oil and dispersants: Insights into potential degradation pathways of exopolymeric substances (EPS) from oil-degrading bacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taylor Royalty","Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565049960,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568052550,"objectID":"e66a4fed0bc492eb785d374bb2394f34","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2019_royalty_steen_mags/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:06:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_royalty_steen_mags/","section":"publication","summary":"We applied theoretical and simulation-based approaches to characterize how microbial community structure influences the amount of sequencing effort to reconstruct metagenomes that are assembled from short-read sequences.

Simulations demonstrated that while community richness and evenness influenced the sequencing effort required to sequence a community metagenome to exhaustion, the effort necessary to sequence an individual genome to a target fraction of exhaustion depended only on the relative abundance of the ge- nome and its genome size. A second analysis evaluated the quantity, completion, and contamination of complete-metagenome-assembled genome equivalents, a bioinformatic pipeline normalized metric for metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) quantity, as a function of sequencing effort on four preexisting sequence read data sets from different environments. These data sets were subsampled to various degrees of completeness to simulate the effect of sequencing effort on MAG retrieval. Modeling suggested that sequencing efforts beyond what is typical in published experiments (1 to 10 Gbp) would generate diminishing returns in terms of MAG bin- ning. A software tool, Genome Relative Abundance to Sequencing Effort (GRASE), was created to assist investigators to further explore this relationship. Reevaluation of the relationship between sequencing effort and binning success in the context of genome relative abundance, as opposed to base pairs, provides a constraint on sequencing experiments based on the relative abundance of microbes in an environ- ment rather than arbitrary levels of sequencing effort.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Theoretical and Simulation-Based Investigation of the Relationship between Sequencing Effort, Microbial Community Richness, and Diversity in Binning Metagenome-Assembled Genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568079653,"objectID":"e96cfac48fa982e6959318d4a941f4d3","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2019_steen_et_al_isme/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_steen_et_al_isme/","section":"publication","summary":"A recent paper by Martiny argues that “high proportions” of bacteria in diverse Earth environments have been cultured.

In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (D-phenylalanine and L-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on L-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Kinetics and Identities of Extracellular Peptidases in Subsurface Sediments of the White Oak River Estuary, North Carolina","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Extracellular enzymes in marine sediments: A control on organic carbon preservation  Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

The enivronmental impact of permafrost thawing will depend greatly on the microbial metabolic processes that drive those transformations, and the relative quantities of greenhouse gasses produced vs organic preserved or exported. In this project, which has been recommended for funding by the Department of Energy, we will use a broad spectrum of techniques, including metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, thawing experiments, and geochemical modeling to understand the microbial and biogeochemical dynamics of thawing permafrost in Svalbard. The project team is lead by Karen Lloyd of the University of Tennessee Department of Microbiology, and includes Drew Steen and Tatiana Vishnivetskaya, also of UT-K, Tullis Onstott of Princeton University, Robert Hettich of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and John Cliff of Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Some functions appeared to be shared by multiple lineages, such as trehalose production and NAD+-consuming deacetylation, both of which have been shown to increase cellular life spans in other organisms by stabilizing proteins and nucleic acids, respectively. Other possible subsistence mechanisms differed between lineages, possibly providing them different physiological niches. Enzyme assays and transcripts suggested that Atribacteria and Actinobacteria group OPB41 catabolized sugars, whereas Aminicenantes and Atribacteria catabolized peptides. Metabolite and transcript data suggested that Atribacteria utilized allantoin, possibly as an energetic substrate or chemical protectant, and also possessed energy-efficient sodium pumps. Atribacteria single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) recruited transcripts for full pathways for the production of all 20 canonical amino acids, and the gene for amino acid exporter YddG was one of their most highly transcribed genes, suggesting that they may benefit from metabolic interdependence with other cells.

As a first step toward uncovering mediating processes, the interactive effects of distinct pools of OM on the growth and respiration of marine bacteria, individual strains and a simple, constructed community of Roseobacter lineage members were tested. Isolates were provided with natural organic matter (NOM) and different concentrations (1, 4, 40, 400 μM-C) and forms of labile OM (acetate, casamino acids, tryptone, coumarate). The microbial response to the mixed substrate regimes was assessed using viable counts and respiration in two separate experiments. Two marine bacteria and a six-member constructed community were assayed with these experiments. Both synergistic and antagonistic growth responses were evident for all strains, but all were transient. The specific substrate conditions promoting a response, and the direction of that response, varied amongst species. These findings indicate that the substrate conditions that result in OM interactive effects are both transient and species-specific and thus influenced by both the composition and metabolic potential of a microbial community.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Characterization of the Interactive Effects of Labile and Recalcitrant Organic Matter on Microbial Growth and Metabolism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1523577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567697109,"objectID":"4ded2013ffc2423ae417a390aa5a8f2d","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2018_matzek_persulfate/","publishdate":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_matzek_persulfate/","section":"publication","summary":"This study offers insight into the roles anodic and cathodic processes play in electrochemically activated persulfate (EAP) and screens EAP as a viable technique for ciprofloxacin degradation in wastewater.

Here, we report kinetic measurements of extracellular hydrolysis of five substrates in 28 freshwater bodies in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in the Pocono Mountains (PA, United States) and near Knoxville (TN, United States), between 2013 and 2016. The assays putatively test for four aminopeptidases (arginyl aminopeptidase, glyclyl aminopeptidase, Leu-AP, and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase), which cleave N-terminal amino acids from proteins, and trypsin, an endopeptidase, which cleaves proteins mid-chain. Aminopeptidase and the trypsin-like activity were observed in all water bodies, indicating that a diverse set of peptidases is typical in freshwater. However, ratios of peptidase activities were variable among sites: aminopeptidases dominated at some sites and trypsin-like activity at others. At a given site, the ratios remained fairly consistent over time, indicating that they are driven by ecological factors. Studies in which only Leu-AP activity is measured may underestimate the total peptidolytic capacity of an environment, due to the variable contribution of endopeptidases.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Potential Activities of Freshwater Exo- and Endo-Acting Extracellular Peptidases in East Tennessee and the Pocono Mountains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"#","date":1491177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567777234,"objectID":"a0fa9211435212a091a4208c88127126","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2017_mahmoudi_isocarb/","publishdate":"2017-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_mahmoudi_isocarb/","section":"publication","summary":"Aquatic sediments harbour diverse microbial communities that mediate organic matter degradation and influence biogeochemical cycles.

We found that amendment with labile protein plus phosphorus increased remineralization rates of degraded, phytoplankton-derived OM by up to 100%, whereas acetate slightly decreased remineralization rates relative to an unamended control. Addition of ammonium and phosphate induced a smaller effect, whereas addition of ammonium alone had no effect. Counterintuitively, alkaline phosphatase activities increased in response to the addition of protein under P-replete conditions, indicating that production of enzymes unrelated to the labile priming compound may be a mechanism for the priming effect. The observed priming effect was transient: after 36 days of incubation roughly the same quantity of organic carbon had been mineralized in all treatments including no-addition controls. This timescale is on the order of the typical hydrologic residence times of well-flushed estuaries suggesting that priming in estuaries has the potential to influence whether OC is remineralized in situ or exported to the coastal ocean.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Evidence for the Priming Effect in a Planktonic Estuarine Microbial Community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"#","date":1434758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567620477,"objectID":"46703a3ddc35a484017c692998fd104c","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2015_steen_et_al_subs_specificity/","publishdate":"2015-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_steen_et_al_subs_specificity/","section":"publication","summary":"The identities and biochemical properties of extracellular enzymes present in natural environments are poorly constrained.

Patterns of substrate affinity showed that Leu-AMC (at both sampling sites) and Arg-AMC (at Bogue Sound) were primarily hydrolyzed by enzymes other than leucyl-aminopeptidase and arginyl-aminopeptidase, respectively. The set of naturally occurring peptidases in both environments showed greater affinity towards a subset of amino acids. These amino acids were on average larger, yielded more free energy from oxidation to CO2, and tended to be depleted in aged organic matter.

In part, this disconnect arises because the environmental parameters that control enzyme activities in terrestrial and freshwater systems, such as temperature, pH, and moisture content, have little explanatory power for patterns of enzyme activities in marine systems. Instead, factors such as the functional diversity of microbial communities may explain varying patterns of enzyme activities observed in the ocean to date. In any case, many studies across systems focus on similar issues that highlight the commonalities of microbial community organization. Examples include the effective lifetime of enzymes released into the environment; the extent to which microbial communities coordinate enzyme expression to decompose complex organic substrates; and the influence of microbial community composition on enzyme activities and kinetics. Here we review the often-disparate research foci in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. We consider the extent to which environmental factors may regulate extracellular enzyme activities within each ecosystem, and highlight commonalities and current methodological challenges to identify research questions that may aid in integrating crosssystem perspectives in the future.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Extracellular enzymes in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments: Perspectives on system variability and common research needs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"Cool thing about this paper: Lead author Zena Cardman was an undergraduate student in the Teske Lab at UNC when she did this work.

In an Arctic fjord (Smeerenburgfjord) of Svalbard, members of the Verrucomicrobia, together with Flavobacteria and smaller proportions of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, constituted the most frequently detected bacterioplankton community members in 16S rRNA gene-based clone library analyses of the water column. Parallel measurements in the water column of the activities of six endo-acting polysaccharide hydrolases showed that chondroitin sulfate, laminarin, and xylan hydrolysis accounted for most of the activity. Several Verrucomicrobia water column phylotypes were affiliated with previously sequenced, glycoside hydrolase-rich genomes of individual Verrucomicrobia cells that bound fluorescently labeled laminarin and xylan and therefore constituted candidates for laminarin and xylan hydrolysis. In sediments, the bacterial community was dominated by different lineages of Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria but also included members of multiple phylum-level lineages not observed in the water column. This community hydrolyzed laminarin, xylan, chondroitin sulfate, and three additional polysaccharide substrates at high rates. Comparisons with data from the same fjord in the previous summer showed that the bacterial community in Smeerenburgfjord changed in composition, most conspicuously in the changing detection frequency of Verrucomicrobia in the water column. Nonetheless, in both years the community hydrolyzed the same polysaccharide substrates.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Verrucomicrobia Are Candidates for Polysaccharide-Degrading Bacterioplankton in an Arctic Fjord of Svalbard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"#","date":1380844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567620477,"objectID":"e9d5d3efcf158d97d9bfc1b497ff1350","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2013_lloyd_et_al_metaanalysis/","publishdate":"2013-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013_lloyd_et_al_metaanalysis/","section":"publication","summary":"The identities and biochemical properties of extracellular enzymes present in natural environments are poorly constrained. We used a series of competitive inhibition experiments with samples from a freshwater environment (the Tennessee River at Knoxville, TN, USA) and a marine environment (Bogue Sound, NC, USA) to characterize the range of substrate specificities of naturally occurring enzymes that hydrolyze L-leucine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Leu-AMC), L‑proline-AMC (Pro-AMC), and L-arginine-AMC (Arg-AMC)—putative substrates for leucyl-aminopeptidase, prolyl-aminopeptidase, and arginyl-aminopeptidase, respectively. Extracellular peptidases which hydrolyzed Arg-AMC and Leu-AMC demonstrated affinity for up to 8 other amino acids, whereas those hydrolyzing Pro-AMC in the Tennessee River, and Arg-AMC at Bogue Sound, were more specific to proline and arginine, respectively. Patterns of substrate affinity showed that Leu-AMC (at both sampling sites) and Arg-AMC (at Bogue Sound) were primarily hydrolyzed by enzymes other than leucyl-aminopeptidase and arginyl-aminopeptidase, respectively. The set of naturally occurring peptidases in both environments showed greater affinity towards a subset of amino acids. These amino acids were on average larger, yielded more free energy from oxidation to CO2, and tended to be depleted in aged organic matter. These relationships indicate that pathways of amino acid diagenesis are at least partially controlled by the substrate specificities of the peptidases involved in protein degradation.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Meta-Analysis of Quantification Methods Shows that Archaea and Bacteria Have Similar Abundances in the Subseafloor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567777234,"objectID":"9401ae4152bab53c8d4deb1139c2945c","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2018_lloyd_et_al_uncultured/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_lloyd_et_al_uncultured/","section":"publication","summary":"To describe a microbe’s physiology, including its metabolism, environmental roles, and growth characteristics, it must be grown in a laboratory culture. Unfortunately, many phylogenetically novel groups have never been cultured, so their physiologies have only been inferred from genomics and environmental characteristics. Although the diversity, or number of different taxonomic groups, of uncultured clades has been studied well, their global abundances, or numbers of cells in any given environment, have not been assessed. We quantified the degree of similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences from diverse environments in publicly available metagenome and metatranscriptome databases, which we show have far less of the culture bias present in primer-amplified 16S rRNA gene surveys, to those of their nearest cultured relatives. Whether normalized to scaffold read depths or not, the highest abundances of metagenomic 16S rRNA gene sequences belong to phylogenetically novel uncultured groups in seawater, freshwater, terrestrial subsurface, soil, hypersaline environments, marine sediment, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, nonhuman hosts, snow, and bioreactors (22\u0026#37; to 87\u0026#37; uncultured genera to classes and 0% to 64% uncultured phyla). The exceptions were human and human-associated environments, which were dominated by cultured genera (45% to 97%). We estimate that uncultured genera and phyla could comprise 7.3 × 1029 (81%) and 2.2 × 1029 (25%) of microbial cells, respectively. Uncultured phyla were overrepresented in metatranscriptomes relative to metagenomes (46% to 84% of sequences in a given environment), suggesting that they are viable. Therefore, uncultured microbes, often from deeply phylogenetically divergent groups, dominate nonhuman environments on Earth, and their undiscovered physiologies may matter for Earth systems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Phylogenetically Novel Uncultured Microbial Cells Dominate Earth Microbiomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Drew Steen"],"categories":null,"content":"I was privileged to play small part in writing this Consensus Statement, in which a large group of people who study uncultured microbes argue that we need a way to assign formal names to uncultured microbes.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599183515,"objectID":"ecd78f1c8971ec3ae9829fbaa9f4fc90","permalink":"https://adsteen.github.io/publication/2020_murray_roadmap/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_murray_roadmap/","section":"publication","summary":"The assembly of single-amplified genomes (SAGs) and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) has led to a surge in genome-based discoveries of members affiliated with Archaea and Bacteria, bringing with it a need to develop guidelines for nomenclature of uncultivated microorganisms. The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) only recognizes cultures as ‘type material’, thereby preventing the naming of uncultivated organisms. In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Roadmap for naming uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria","type":"publication"}]
