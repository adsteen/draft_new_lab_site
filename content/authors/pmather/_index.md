I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2016 with a BS in Geology and Environmental Studies and from Vermont Law School with a Juris Doctor degree in 2020. I am interested in the fields of Natural Resource Management, specifically concerning water availability issues. My second passion is education and assisting post-secondary institutions to provide the best quality education and services to the students that attend them.
