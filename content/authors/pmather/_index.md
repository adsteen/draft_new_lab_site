I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 2016 with a BS in Geology and Environmental Studies. I am in the process of getting a Juris Doctor Degree from Vermont Law School with a graduation date of May 16, 2020. My goal is to take the Bar Exam in July of the same year. I am interested in the fields of Natural Resource Management, specifically concerning water availability issues. My second passion is education and assisting post-secondary institutions to provide the best quality education and services to the students that attend them.
