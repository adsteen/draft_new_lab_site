I am interested in studying how various chemical species behave on a molecular scale in water-rock-soil-life systems (environmental geochemistry). I also enjoy looking into employing isotopic tracers as a way to understand paleoocean environments. Broadly, I seek to understand and model what chemical behaviors have measurable impacts from a geological standpoint.
