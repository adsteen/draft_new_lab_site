I started working in the Steen lab in the spring of 2021 after working with [Dr. Tongye Shen](http://bcmb.utk.edu/people/faculty/tongye-shen/) on protein ligand binding. I am now studying the extent to which extracellular glycosylases expressed by microbes in the ocean rely on carbohydrate binding modules, in order to better understand the marine cycle of dissolved organic carbon. I plan to attend dental school after receiving my undergraduate degree.
