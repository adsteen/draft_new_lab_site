Lauren earned her Ph.D. in Microbiology at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville in [Dr. Alison Buchanâ€™s lab](https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/buchanlab/home), with Dr. Steen as a co-advisor. Her dissertation focused on microbial degradation of plant-derived carbon in the salt marshes of the southeastern United States. Since graduating in 2018, she completed a postdoctoral appointment at the [Forsyth Institute](https://forsyth.org) in Boston where she studied how microbial interactions in the nasal microbiome influence Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Lauren is currently the research scientist at [1CellBio](https://1cell-bio.com/) where she works to develop and adapt 'omics techniques to work in droplets on a single-cell scale.
