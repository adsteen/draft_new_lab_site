Taylor is interested in using data science approaches to better understand the distribution of microbial functions across phylogeny and space. After earning a Ph.D. in Geology from UT-Knoxville in three years, he moved to a position as a post-doc in the Steen Lab, where he is working on using neural networks for better understand genomes of uncultured microorganisms in thawing Arctic permafrost.
