Taylor is interested in using data science approaches to better understand the distribution of microbial functions across phylogeny and space. After earning a Ph.D. in Geology from UT-Knoxville in three years, he moved to a position as a post-doc in the Steen Lab, where he used using data science tools to better understand the structure and function of microbial communities.

Taylor is now a scientist at [SomaLogic](https://somalogic.com/) working on designing aptamers.
