I believe that four principles are essential to success in science, and I encourage all students to practice these principles when they're in the Steen Lab. I have also established some specific rules and expectations that are in line with those principles.

# Principles

## Be creative

* **Read the literature**: papers that you're assigned to read, and papers that you find on your own.
* **Discuss ideas** with your lab mates.
* **Write**. A scientist is, at the end of the day, a writer. Writing is important at all stages of a project, from generating ideas and planning experiments to communicating final results. 

## Take care of yourself

* **Get enough sleep**. Even fairly moderate sleep loss has similar cognitive effects to being [too drunk to drive](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2869.1999.00167.x). 
* Do what you need to **take care of your body, mind, and soul**. Eat well, get some exercise, have a social life outside of lab.
* **Put safety first**.
* **Ask for help** from your labmates, Drew, and the scientific community at large.

## Take care of your lab-mates

* **Help your labmates**. Science is a team sport, and you want to help your team succeed.
* **Practice anti-bigotry**. Racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry are common in science, just as they are in the broader society. To remain neutral is to perpetuate that bigotry.
* (I feel like there's a third point to add here but I can't think of what it is.)

## Take responsibility for your career

* **Take charge of reading papers**. Find the papers that are important for your project and read them on your own.
* **Take charge of writing papers**. The way to get papers published is to start writing yourself.
* **Advocate for yourself** within the lab, with Drew, and in the broader scientific community. 
* **Put in the time** in lab and in front of your computer. We don't punch a clock in science, but we also don't finish projects without putting in the hours.

# Rules and Expectations

## Safety

* Take all relevant safety training. At minimum all lab members should complete the general lab safety course or lab safety for undergraduate students, as appropriate.
* Review the lab safety manual.
* 

## The practice of science

* Record all your work in a lab notebook. We will provide you with one. Lab notebook pages should be formatted as described [here]() *link to come*.
* Store all data on the lab Google Drive site (or marie as appropriate). If possible, you should install the Drive File Stream app on your computer, so the lab drive will appear on your hard drive.
* Use high-quality passwords for your UTK account and your marie account. A password manager such as [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) is helpful in this regard.

## Time in lab and time away

* We don't punch a clock in the lab. However, lab members are expected to be available:
    - *Graduate students and more senior personnel*: generally during working hours (9-5, more or less).
    - *Undergraduates*: at least about 10 hours a week, on a schedule agreed with Drew.
* Lab meetings
* One-on-one meetings
* *Ad hoc* meetings

## Take care of yourself

You can't be creative when you're miserable. 

* Get enough sleep.
    - Even relatively moderate sleep loss has similar cognitive effects to being [too drunk to drive](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2869.1999.00167.x).
* Do what you need to take care of your body, mind and soul.
* **Safety comes first.** 
* Advocate for yourself with Dr. Steen. I'll always try to

# Take care of your colleagues

* **Racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated.** If you feel that you are experiencing discrimination or harassment, you may speak to Drew, or to the UTK [Title IX office](https://titleix.utk.edu/students/reporting-an-incident/). 
    - Note that almost all UTK staff, including all faculty, are [*mandatory reporters*](https://titleix.utk.edu/faculty-and-staff/mandatory-reporters/) for sexual harrassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking, sexual exploitation and retaliation. All mandatory reporters are legally required to communicate reports of these things to the UTK Title IX office.
* Help out your lab-mates when you get the chance. Science is a group activity.
