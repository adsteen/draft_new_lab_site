Most of the molecules that organisms synthesize are polymeric, and so most of the bioavailable organic matter in the environment consists of high-molecular weight molecules. In order to access these molecules, heterotrophic microbes must first break them down into smaller units (although there are some intersting, [newly-discovered exceptions](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201726) to this rule.) Thus, the ability of microbial communities to express extracellular enzymes, and the dynamics of those enzymes once produced, serve as a proximate control on the remineralization of organic matter, and thus the Earth's carbon cycle. We study the nature, dynamics, and controls on microbial extracellular enzymes in aquatic environments.
